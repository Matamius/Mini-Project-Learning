This is a revamped set of code centered around mini projects I come up with to practice 
certain skills related to Python. 

Ideally, these practices should result in the ability to produce my overarching project
of designing Web Scraper for Bioinformatics Purposes. The details will be related to 
that page and be found there. Instead, this directory will be related to numerous small
projects I am interested in pursuing, with a theme of Bioinformatics development.

Note: I am currently overhauling and redoing this entire repository so as I get 
everything put together, I will be adding .py files and other files.

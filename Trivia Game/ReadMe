This is a slight bit of code I am working on, it is a simple 10 question quiz 
that is designed to be played in a python console. As I understand more about 
GUI's and API's I will attempt to make it into a little executable.

Stage one goal: Fill with 10 questions about bioinformatics and principles
Stage two goal: Add more questions
Stage three goal: As more questions are added, randomize it.


Question Ideas: 
1) Have some questions that randomize prompt (i.e., DNA seq) and 
   have user input be the reverse complement 
  a) for now just have static prompt, will need to learn how to have this be randomized

2) A-D questions involving best choice databases to retrieve information from

3) Identify phylogeny algorithm calculation concepts like distance-based modeling

I am considering making it so that a text file holds a repository of questions so that 
it draws from the text file, this should keep the .py file short and sweet
This will require reading and opening files.

Idea inspiration: Quizlet

Key concepts: basic functions, validation checkpoints, read from file   

Imports: sys

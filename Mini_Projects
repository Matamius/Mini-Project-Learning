This is a slight bit of code I am working on, it is a simple 10 question quiz 
that is designed to be played in a python console. As I understand more about 
GUI's and API's I will attempt to make it into a little executable.

Stage one goal: Fill with 10 questions about bioinformatics and principles
Stage two goal: Add more questions
Stage three goal: As more questions are added, randomize it.


Question Ideas: 
1) Have some questions that randomize prompt (i.e., DNA seq) and 
   have user input be the reverse complement 
  a) for now just have static prompt, will need to learn how to have this be randomized

2) A-D questions involving best choice databases to retrieve information from

3) Identify phylogeny algorithm calculation concepts like distance-based modeling

Idea inspiration: Quizlet

Key concepts: basic functions and validation checkpoints

Imports: sys
